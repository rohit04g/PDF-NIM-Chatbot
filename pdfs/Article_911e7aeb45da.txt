There’s a certain peace in letting go of control, in believing that what is truly yours will always find its way back to you. It’s not easy to trust in something so intangible, especially in a world that glorifies chasing, achieving, and possessing. But this thought—that what is meant for you will come—feels like a soft promise in the chaos of life.

I’ve spent years questioning the timing of my life, wondering if I missed out on opportunities or if I wasn’t enough for certain dreams to take root. There were moments I clung too tightly to things, afraid to lose them. But those very things—relationships, jobs, ambitions—slipped away anyway. At the time, it felt like failure, like life was punishing me for not being stronger, smarter, or more deserving.

With time, I’ve come to understand that not everything that leaves is a loss. Some things are not ours to keep, no matter how much we want them to be. They were lessons, moments of growth, or temporary comforts meant to prepare us for something greater. What is truly ours doesn’t require a desperate grip. It flows into our lives effortlessly, often when we least expect it.

This doesn’t mean we stop trying or striving. It means we stop forcing. We work toward what we want, but we let go of the outcome. We trust that the doors meant to open will open when the time is right, and the ones that remain closed were never ours to walk through.

There’s beauty in this surrender. It’s the kind of beauty that comes with understanding that life has its own rhythm, one that we can’t always hear but must learn to trust. It’s about letting life surprise us, letting the unknown shape us, and knowing that the things meant for us are already on their way.

Every day, I remind myself to release my grip on control, to make space for what is meant to arrive. Because in the end, what is mine will find me. And when it does, I will be ready. Sometimes, this belief feels like a leap of faith. It demands patience and resilience, especially in moments of uncertainty. When life feels stagnant, or when the absence of what I long for becomes unbearable, the doubt creeps in. What if I’ve been waiting in vain? What if the things meant for me are lost along the way?

But then I remind myself: nothing truly meant for me can ever be lost. The universe doesn’t work on my timeline, but it works. It rearranges, it tests, it teaches. And in the quiet moments when I pause to reflect, I see glimpses of this truth. I see how the heartbreaks shaped my strength, how missed opportunities redirected me to better paths, how the things I once thought I couldn’t live without gave way to things I can’t imagine living without now.

This journey of trusting what is mine will find me is ongoing. It requires me to release my fears and to let life unfold as it should. It requires me to meet life halfway—to prepare, to grow, to open myself to possibilities I can’t yet see. The closure to this belief isn’t in reaching the destination but in finding peace along the way. It’s in knowing that even if today feels incomplete, the pieces are still falling into place. It’s in understanding that sometimes, the wait is part of the gift, shaping me into someone ready to receive.

And so, I choose to walk forward with an open heart and open hands, trusting the process. Because what is mine will always find me, and when it does, it will feel like coming home.
