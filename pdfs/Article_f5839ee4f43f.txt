I read Meditations in 2020, during one of the most difficult times of my life. I was then employed as a pollution testing boy, working my days breathing in thick, filthy air from thousands of vehicles. But it wasn't only the air that was polluted, my mind was heavy too. I was lost, wondering who I was and where I was going. Life was a never-ending loop of fatigue, and I had no idea how to escape it.

That's when I discovered Meditations, or perhaps Meditations discovered me.

It's not exactly a book per se, it's Marcus Aurelius' personal journal, a compilation of his thoughts he penned only for his own eyes. There is no formal philosophy, no attempt at sounding sage, but just a man reminding himself how to conduct himself. And yet, his words, penned nearly 2,000 years prior, addressed me in a manner that no other book had.

Choosing Virtue Over satisfaction

Marcus Aurelius was the most influential man on earth at that time. As the Emperor of Rome, he had unlimited money, pleasure, and power at his disposal. He could have done anything, taken anything, indulged in anything. And yet, he opted for discipline, humility, and virtue.

That thought resonated with me profoundly. In a world that's always urging us to pursue money, success, and material things, Meditations reminded me that real happiness is an internal thing. I was already questioning material wants at the time, attempting to break free from the cycle of needing more. This book provided me with a foundation, a means to live life with direction, even when the world around me seemed to be pushing in the opposite direction.

But unattachment to material things comes hard. Even today, I find it hard to do so in a world that surrounds us with the assertion that happiness is something we can purchase. But Marcus Aurelius words of wisdom remind me to shift my priorities when I catch myself getting out of line. He reminds me that the best a human being can obtain is not riches, but character.

The Nature of People and Time

One of the best things that Meditations taught me was how to handle bad people and situations. Marcus Aurelius consistently wrote that bad people are just a part of life. Just as a vine cannot bear fruit without thorns, the world could not exist without selfishness, ignorance, and cruelty.

Rather than hating this, he learned to accept it. Other people do things the way they do because they are limited in some way, not because they are consciously out to hurt us. That minor change of thinking altered the manner in which I perceived challenges within my own life.

And now, every time I am faced with setbacks, betrayal, or nasty individuals, I remember that time is a coin, it has two sides, and they are both linked. The bad times are not detached from the good, they precede them, define them. Just as the night turns to day, difficulty gives way to expansion.

I ceased fighting adversity and began accepting it as part of the journey.

The Power of Being Present

Perhaps the lesson most repeated throughout Meditations is the value of being present, of being fully present. The past is lost, the future is not ours to know, and the only thing we really get to decide is how we react to this instant.

I recall reading that and seeing how much of my time I spent either brooding over the past or fretting about the future. I was hardly ever in the present at all. But Marcus Aurelius reminded me that life is now. This moment is the only thing that actually belongs to us.

That simplicity made me see my days differently. Instead of envying what my life could be, I began to make the most of what it did happen to be. Even on the most drained days, I reminded myself that I had the option, to hate my existence or to become a participant.

Staying Good in a Corrupt World

All through this, Marcus Aurelius was gentle. Even when the world around him was greed, anger, and corruption, he did not allow it to alter him. He did not allow power to turn him cruel. He thought that being good was not because it was easy, not because it was paid for, but because it was right.

That, to me, is real strength. It's simple to be kind when all is going well. It's far more difficult to be kind when life is putting you through trials. But that is the true test, to be good even when the world puts every reason in front of you not to be.

This is something I remind myself of every day. When individuals behave greedily, when anger seems like the path of least resistance, when life nudges me toward resentment, I consider Marcus Aurelius. I remind myself that I have no control over the world, but I do have control over how I react to it. And I opt to be good.

A Philosophy for Life

I still go back to Meditations whenever I'm lost. It's not a book, it's a talk with someone who has already struggled with everything that we grapple with today. It doesn't provide answers, but it aids me in posing the right questions.

If anything, Meditations has shown me that life will never be perfect. There will always be suffering, temptation, and times of doubt. But in the midst of it all, we have a choice, to act with virtue, to be present, to persevere, to be good.

And in the end, that is what really matters.
