I was heading back from the gym today when I felt a tap on my left shoulder. I turned back and saw a man with unshaved, white stubble, trying to talk to me.

I knew what it was. I could tell just by looking at him. Sometimes, when I walk down this road, people stop me and ask for help — money, food, anything I can spare. And while I have helped some, I can’t help everyone. But there was something about the way this man looked at me.

I almost walked away. I almost ignored him, let my earbud stay in, and continued forward. But something about the moment made me pause. I instinctively removed the earbud from my left ear as I saw his lips move.

“Do you know Hindi?” he asked.

“Haan, aati hai,” I replied. (Yes, I do.)

He continued, “My house is in Shirdi, Maharashtra. I came here with my wife and daughter for work, but our employer bailed on us after we finished the job. He didn’t pay us, and now we have no money for shelter or food. We just want to go back home.”

I had heard stories like this before. My hesitation kicked in. My scepticism fought with my instinct to help. His wife approached, her palms pressed together, desperation filling her tired eyes.

“Please, bhaiya. We will return the money as soon as we reach home. We just need help now.”

Her voice trembled. The man added, “Please don’t worry about getting the money back. We will return it to you on your phone number when we reach home. We just need to get there.”

I hesitated again. It was easy to say no, to be wary. But looking at them, seeing their child sitting quietly on the footpath, I couldn’t just walk away.

“I’m not bothered about getting the money back,” I admitted, “but I don’t know if what you’re saying is true.”

He reached into his pocket and pulled out his Aadhar card, holding it out to me. I glanced at it but knew there was nothing I could do with the information. It didn’t prove his story; it didn’t change my doubts.

“What help do you need? Do you need food, or do you need a way to travel back home?”

I checked the back of my phone case for emergency cash. I was sure I had enough, but when I pulled it out, I only had 100 rupees. Embarrassed to offer just that, I thought maybe I could at least help them get to the railway station.

“Shall I book an auto for you to the station?” I asked.

His shoulders slumped slightly. “Bhaiya, the auto will get us there, but we have no money for train tickets.”

“Okay… how much do you need?”

“1000 rupees for two tickets.”

A pause. A moment of calculation. 1000 rupees was a lot to ask from a stranger. Do train tickets and expenses really add up to that much? Maybe. Maybe not.

“1000 is too much,” I said finally. “I can give you 500. I’m also a student, and you know how expensive this city is,” I lied. I wasn’t a student anymore, but the lie slipped out easily. Maybe I just needed an excuse to hold back.

“With this, I can manage one ticket,” he said, his voice growing weaker. “But we won’t be able to go home together. Please help us get two tickets. I swear we will pay you back. Please.”

I looked at his daughter again, still sitting quietly, waiting. Something about that image unsettled me.

“Did you eat or drink anything today?” I asked.

“No. But we don’t need this money for food or water. We only need it to go home.”

I sighed. I took out the 100 rupees and handed it to him first. “Get your daughter something to eat. Get some water. Then give me your UPI ID.”

He hesitated, then nodded and opened his phone. I scanned his QR code and sent him the money.

Before leaving, I met his eyes and said, “Please use this money for good. You have a family behind you. I hope you get home.”

Both he and his wife folded their hands in gratitude. “Thank you. You are a good person. We will reach home with this.”

I walked away, but my mind lingered on the interaction. Had I been scammed? Had I genuinely helped someone? It was impossible to know. Trust is fragile, yet sympathy is easy. So I found myself turning back every few steps, watching them. I caught a glimpse of them heading toward a bakery. Maybe he really was buying food for his family.

I smiled.

As I walked, I realized something: we don’t always get to know how our kindness is used. We can only control what we give, not what people do with it. And that has to be enough.

Yes, there are scams. Yes, people might misuse help. But if we let the fear of deception harden us, we risk losing something more valuable than money — our humanity. If we let doubt win, we might close ourselves off to the one moment where our help truly changes someone’s life.

For someone with privilege, 1000 rupees might be a minor expense. For someone in true need, it could be the bridge between despair and survival. And while uncertainty lingers, it doesn’t change the fact that I had the power to help.

But giving isn’t always easy. The emotional weight of it is heavier than the financial one. No one wants to feel cheated for their kindness. No one wants to feel played for being a good human. So we build walls, convincing ourselves it’s safer to say no. We create justifications, choosing skepticism over instinct, because it’s easier to assume the worst than to risk being taken advantage of.

But then I think back to the times strangers have helped me. Like the time my car was in a garage in a faraway town, and I had no internet to book a ride back. A stranger saw me stranded and gave me a lift to the highway so I could find an auto. He didn’t have to. He could’ve just walked away. But he didn’t. His kindness, given without question, helped me. Maybe this was my way of passing it forward.

Maybe, in the end, kindness is a circle. One that we don’t always see come back to us, but one that keeps moving, shaping the world in ways we can’t predict. Perhaps the real test of generosity isn’t whether someone deserves help, but whether we’re willing to give it despite not knowing the outcome.

I know I can’t help everyone. But today, I helped one. And maybe, just maybe, that’s enough. Because kindness isn’t just about changing someone else’s life — it changes us, too.
