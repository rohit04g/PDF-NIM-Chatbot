It’s a cold Parisian Saturday afternoon in February. I step off the metro at Notre-Dame-des-Champs and make my way to Mademoiselle Angelina, the café that claims to serve the richest hot chocolate in Paris — according to Instagram, at least. But truth be told, I’m not here for the hot chocolate. Today’s focus is something much bigger: branding.

As a journalist, I’ve written for various business columns and local papers — both in French and English — but branding has always felt like a topic that deserved closer scrutiny. It’s something we all encounter daily, yet how much do we truly understand about it?

The spark for this article came unexpectedly, during a night of binge-watching Emily in Paris. Yes, you read that right. But beyond the extravagant fashion choices and dubious plot twists, the show offered a unique lens into the world of branding that I couldn’t ignore.

It felt like witnessing the intersection of marketing and culture, all unfolding against the backdrop of Paris. Intrigued, I decided to take a deeper dive, speak with industry experts, and explore what it really takes to build a brand in a city that has long been a symbol of style, elegance, and reinvention.

Fast forward to my meeting with Mira Georgia at Mademoiselle Angelina, hot chocolate in hand and curiosity at the forefront. With her branding studio Maison Gia set to launch on March 1st, its name has already started circulating in the Parisian branding scene. Mira’s studio blends the best of traditional marketing with the ever-evolving world of digital content.

I first encountered Mira at the Salon d’Automne, where she was attending as the agent for Fred Lutz, a contemporary French artist and one of her close friends. Mira, however, is an artist in her own right. In 2024, she participated in the Venice Art Biennale, showcasing her work on an international stage. After our first conversation, Fred reached out to me with an email suggesting I meet Mira. Intrigued, I was excited to learn more, though I’ll admit, I was more eager to hear about the Modigliani exhibit she’d just visited at the Zadkine Museum. (Apparently, Modigliani is one of her favorite artists, which explains her impeccable sense of style. Whether Emily in Paris would agree is another matter, but we’ll let that slide.)

When Mira finally walks in, she’s the epitome of Parisian effortless chic. “Sorry I’m late, I walked from Rue d’Assas,” she says, barely breaking a sweat. I’m convinced I would’ve collapsed halfway across the city — then again, perhaps that’s just my American side showing.

Her philosophy of merging classic branding strategies with modern digital trends is something that reflects the way the world of branding is shifting. According to a recent report from Statista, 83% of marketeers agree that integrating increased exposure into digital strategies is critical for success in today’s landscape. It’s no longer just about print ads or TV spots. Brands are increasingly looking to connect with audiences online in creative, engaging ways — something Mira knows well.

“I see branding as a bridge,” Mira explains, “It’s the connection between a company and its audience, between storytelling and digital interaction. I think you can be bold and provocative but also balanced,” she adds.

Mira’s career is as much of a mix as her background — French, Portuguese, and Bulgarian. Raised in a family of artists, she’s spent her life surrounded by creativity. As a model, graphic designer, and marketing specialist, she’s worn many hats, so naturally, this unusual blend of experiences gives her a unique perspective on branding (and life in general).

“I’ve always been around art,” Mira says, with a soft laugh. “It’s a natural part of how I see and approach everything I do, including marketing. Art isn’t just made to sit in galleries and museums, but about making you feel something, and the can happen through design or a brand story as well. That’s what people connect with.”

Her digital presence is undeniable. With over 20k followers on Instagram and a growing presence, Mira knows what it means to harness social media as a tool for brand building. The blending of digital content creation with marketing is what sets Maison Gia apart. According to a recent Forbes article, the role of influencers in brand marketing has fundamentally changed. With 51% of Gen Z preferring TikTok and Instagram over traditional search engines, brands are shifting their strategies away from conventional advertising and towards influencer-driven recommendations. This only reaffirms the increasing power of digital content creators — trusted voices that consumers see as peers rather than advertisers, which is something Mira is all too familiar with.

“I didn’t set out to be an influencer,” she confesses, “but as I grew my network and started sharing my process, I realized how many people related to it. Now it’s a part of how I approach branding, which is about being authentic and connecting with people on a personal level, while also reflecting my own style in the process.”

It’s easy to assume that branding is all about logos or flashy ad campaigns. But for Mira, it’s about something deeper. “Branding isn’t about what you sell — it’s about how you make people feel,” she says, watching for my reaction. “If you’re not evoking emotion, you’re just selling a product. Anyone can do that.” She has a habit of dropping statements that make you pause, question, and rethink.

“Doesn’t that come off as a bit too provocative? Do people take it well?” I ask, half-expecting her to admit that not everyone loves the bold approach.

Mira chuckles, “Provocative? That depends on what provocative means, non?” she says. “You can be audacious, but still chic. Being bold doesn’t mean you can’t be elegant. I have tried playing it safe and honestly it’s like wearing the same outfit every day — c’est ennuyeux. You have to think outside the box.” She says, referencing one of her brand’s latest campaigns, where she’s pictured falling out of a bag — Some brands fit in a box, others think out of the bag.

It is with this in mind that she decided to go forward with Maison Gia, “I want to do exactly that with companies and individuals — to build brands that tells a story.” To her, it is very simple, “Everyone has at least one thing that defines their story. Once we uncover what that is, we can create something powerful — something lasting and impactful.” Whether through design, digital content, or personalized marketing strategy, the goal is always the same: to create an emotional connection that remains long after the first impression.

As our conversation shifts toward the future of branding, Mira’s thoughts align with what many marketing experts are saying: the digital landscape is only going to grow, and with that growth comes new challenges. But Mira sees opportunity, too.

“Digital is where the future of branding is heading,” she says, glancing out the window at the Parisian street, “but it’s not just about more ads. It’s about creating real value. Using data and personalization to speak directly to an individual’s needs — that’s where branding is headed.”

Indeed, the industry is leaning into personalization, with 80% of consumers saying they’re more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences, according to Epsilon. With tools like AI and data analytics becoming more accessible, brands can now tailor their messaging and campaigns like never before. And Mira? She’s already there: “I want people who work with me to feel like they’re part of the process, to have the ability to tailor everything to their needs,” she says. “Not every business has a big budget, so it’s important to prioritize what they need. Some might already have a logo and a few elements to work with, while others may be starting from scratch and need help building their brand from the ground up.”

Despite all the technicalities of branding, Mira keeps a creative and artistic outlook, one that she attributes to her upbringing. “Creativity is the root of all of this,” she says, her voice softening. “Marketing, design, even influencing — they’re all forms of art. I don’t think we can separate creativity from branding. They fuel each other.”

Curious, I ask, “How does this artistic perspective connect to the idea behind starting your own studio?” Mira grins, leaning in slightly, as if sharing a secret. “It’s simple. I wanted to create something that blends creativity with strategy. Maison Gia is about making connections between brands and their audience, but in a way that feels… well, human — not just a bunch of numbers and algorithms. We’re telling stories. I don’t just want to sell products — I want people to feel like they’re part of something, with art as the foundation for everything we do. It’s not rocket science… but almost,” she laughs.

As our hot chocolate grows colder — unfortunately sidelined by our impassioned debate on the future of marketing — one thing becomes clear: branding’s future is in good hands. Maison Gia might be set to make waves, but it’s clear that it’s not just about a catchy name or a well-timed slogan. As I sit back and reflect on everything I’ve just learned, it’s become evident that the approach is much more nuanced than simply leveraging the latest digital trends, and rather to create genuine connection between brands and their audience. And while that sounds simple enough in theory, it’s not something every business gets right.

Looking ahead, it’s clear that the brands that will thrive are those that evolve, yet remain grounded in authenticity. Storytelling, innovative digital strategies, and a touch of artistic flair will be key to standing out in a crowded market. And judging by the direction things are going, I wouldn’t be surprised if Emily in Paris has to start rewriting its script to keep up.
