Hey there, it’s Darius Foroux. You’re receiving this Short Take post because you signed up for my Medium newsletter.

I’m publishing it here on Medium and on Substack (where these pieces will appear first).

Ever since ChatGPT blew up in November 2022, things have really changed.

At first, it was just a silly tool — something to play around with. It was just a Q&A machine. But over time, I started using it every day.

Most people still don’t use AI seriously. Think about it. More than 3 billion people use Facebook.

And only 300 million people are currently using ChatGPT. And more than half of those folks are students!

Real people have heard about it, maybe tried it once or twice, but they don’t really know how to make it useful.

That’s a mistake. If you want to stay ahead, you need to figure out how AI fits into your life — not just as a gadget, but as an extension of your mind.

Here’s how I use AI to get more done, think better, and make faster decisions.

Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, put it best: “Either you will be replaced by AI, or you will be replaced by someone using AI.”

No one really knows what’s about to happen. But from what I can see, AI is going to change everything.

If you don’t start using it now, it’s safe to say you’re going to fall behind.

So, experiment. Try things. See what works. The sooner you get comfortable with AI, the bigger the advantage you’ll have.
