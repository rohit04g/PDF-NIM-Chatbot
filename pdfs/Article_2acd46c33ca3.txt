Kaixo, friends — as we say hello in Basque.

Welcome back to Rooted & Rising! If you’re here, it means you’re asking the same big question I’ve been obsessing over: How do I turn my passion for the environment into a heart-centered, cool career that actually pays the bills?

But before we get into it, I have something to confess.

Scroll down to jump direcly into this week´s newsletter.

Truth is — I’m figuring it out right alongside you. But I’m not just casually exploring; I’ve made this my full-time mission. Oh yeah. I spend my days researching, connecting with environmental heroes, uncovering the strategies that work (and the ones that don’t) and distilling everything I learn into practical, actionable insights — so you don’t have to navigate this alone. And let me tell you, I am super excited to uncover my findings throughout this publication — like super, SUPER excited — I´ve got some good stuff for you.

(Pss, I am also working on my own little cool and heart-centered project ;) )

Last time, we skimmed the surface of how real-life environmental heroes are building meaningful careers on their own terms. We´ve tackled the big existential crisis: Can you really make a living while saving the planet? (Short answer: Absofreakinlutely.)

So, buckle up. Get comfortable, but not too comfortable. Stay hungry and curious to explore the unexpected twists and turns and the uncharted terriotories that your super-cool-impactul-AND-succesful career journey has in store.

Okay.

Now, it’s time to map out the five main career paths in sustainability, so you can start finding where you fit in this movement.

But let’s be real — The sustainability job market is like a jungle: crowded with opportunity but filled with confusing pathways, unexpected obstacles, and the occasional corporate predator disguised in greenwashing camouflage.

But fear not, eco-warrior! Whether you’re a fresh graduate, a mid-career wanderer, or just someone staring at your laptop thinking, “There’s got to be more to life than this,” I got you.

Let’s break down the five main paths to a green career and help you find where you fit in this great planetary puzzle.

Later this week you´ll receive a QUIZ where you´ll find out which of the five green career paths suits your skills, values, and personality. On following newsletters we will go in depth into each path, where we´ll find and examine diverse and unexpected possibilities through case studies– to get clarity on what is for you, equip you and set you on that path. Let´s go!

Let me be your guide through this jungle. 🌿 I’ll walk you through each of the five main paths in, breaking them down so you can see where you truly belong. You’ll discover which one aligns with your skills, passions, and personality — but fair warning, it’s not all smooth sailing. Every path has its own hidden pitfalls, and I’ll expose them all so you don’t have to learn the hard way.

You’ve decided to bring change from the inside — good choice. The business world is waking up to sustainability — not just because it’s the right thing to do, but because it’s profitable. It´s about survival. Companies are scrambling to lower emissions, reduce waste, and avoid getting canceled for greenwashing. That’s where you come in.

Think of this as eco-reform from the inside out. If you’ve got a knack for strategy and a stomach for boardroom politics, this is your lane.

Jobs You Might Love:

The Catch: The corporate world can be slow-moving, bureaucratic, and, let’s face it, sometimes performative about its green efforts. Progress is slow. You’ll have to master the art of persuasion (and patience) while navigating the corporate labyrinth.

For those who want their entire job to be about making a difference — welcome to the nonprofit world. It’s where passion meets policy, and where underfunded dreams somehow manage to change lives.

Passion-led, purpose-driven, and — let’s be honest — sometimes wildly underfunded. The nonprofit world is where warriors with a cause are drawn to, but it’s also where financial security can feel shaky.

Jobs That Change the Game:

The Catch: Budgets are tight. You might find yourself writing more grant proposals than actually saving trees. But if you’re resourceful and persistent, the impact is worth it.

Entrepreneurs– gotta love them. If you’re tired of waiting for companies and governments to get it together, then maybe you are the solution. Green businesses are popping up everywhere, from zero-waste stores to sustainable tech startups.

You’ve got ideas, you see the gaps, and you’re ready to launch something world-changing. Amazing.

Ideas to Get You Thinking:

But let’s talk survival — because passion alone won’t keep the lights on.

The Catch: It’s a rollercoaster. Financial risk? High. Impact potential? Even higher. But if you love freedom, risk taking , creativity and problem-solving, this could be your dream path.

If you’ve ever felt like grabbing a megaphone and shouting, “Do better!” at the world, you might be an activist at heart. This path isn’t just about protesting — it’s about mobilizing, educating, and pushing for systemic change.

If you’re drawn to movement-building, advocacy, or policy change, you’re in the right place. And I´ve got good news for you! — activism doesn’t always mean working for free. There are ways to sustain yourself while sustaining the planet– but we gotta find them.

Ways to Make It Your Job:

The Catch: It’s exhausting. Wins can be slow and setbacks frequent. But you´ll feel part of something bigger and your heart will feel rewarded.

If you’re the kind of person who gets excited about data, discoveries, and solving big problems with science…this onemight be for you. Researchers and educators are the backbone of environmental progress — pushing the boundaries of what we know and training the next generation of sustainability leaders.

Jobs That Drive Change:

The Catch: Funding is competitive, academia can be slow-moving, and breaking into tenured positions is tough. But if you love deep thinking, discovery, and influencing long-term change, this path is powerful!

Still unsure where you fit? I´ve prepared a quiz for you to gain some clarity. It is a deep dive into your skills, passions and purpose. We´ll go through some questions so that you can get to know yourself better, such as:

And more!

The quiz will reveal your most powerful path to making an impact, whether that’s inside boardrooms, in the streets, out in the blue ocean, or behind a microscope.

Sustainability isn’t a niche anymore — it’s gotta be the future. Whether you want to shake things up from inside a boardroom, run a nonprofit on sheer willpower, build the next game-changing green business, or spark movements that make history, there’s a place for you.

And guess what? You don’t have to stick to just one. No stress. Many people blend these paths throughout their careers — jumping from corporate to nonprofit, from activism to entrepreneurship. The key is to start somewhere and let your journey unfold.

So, where do you see yourself? Hit reply, leave a comment, or just scream your ideas into the void (but, preferably, tell me — I’d love to hear them).

Later this week you´ll receive the quiz to discover which of the five green career paths suits your skills, values, and personality. Don´t miss it!

In the coming weeks, we’ll take a deep dive into each of these career paths — one by one. You’ll get the real story: what it’s like, what it takes, and how to make it work for you. No fluff, no sugarcoating — just real life stories and actionable insights to help you build a career that matters to you.

And this is just the beginning. As I navigate this journey myself, I’ll be sharing everything I uncover — the strategies, the pitfalls, the game-changing insights — so we can build a future where making a living and making a difference go hand in hand.

And let me tell you, that future looks spectacularly fun.

I am tremendously thankful for your support, and I promise I will do my best to support you. I want us to create something only we can, and I trust we will, lagun (friend in Basque)! Let’s figure this out together.
