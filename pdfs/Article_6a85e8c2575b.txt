One of the biggest lies in business is that growth is always good.

We are told that expansion is the goal â€” more customers, more markets, more revenue. But what if I told you that growth is often the enemy of transformation?

To understand this, we have to go back to the 19th century, when candle makers were thriving. For centuries, candles were essential. When the sun went down, you needed a candle.

And thenâ€¦ the lightbulb happened.

Suddenly, the thing that had defined their entire industry was obsolete. Some candle makers doubled down. They made more candles, cheaper candles, bigger candles. But a few understood something deeper:

They werenâ€™t in the candle business. They were in the home goods business.

Companies like Procter & Gamble pivoted â€” they moved into soap, detergents, and personal care products. Instead of fighting a losing battle, they became something new.

The companies that saw themselves as candle makers died.The companies that saw themselves as mentors guiding customers through change flourished.

If transformation is so obviously the answer, why do brands resist it?

In the 1990s, a psychologist named Daniel Kahneman discovered something called status quo bias â€” the human tendency to prefer things as they are, even when change would be better.

This is why Kodak clung to film cameras even though they invented the digital camera. Itâ€™s why Blockbuster refused to evolve even when Netflix was making them irrelevant.

These companies werenâ€™t stupid. They were just human.

Humans â€” and the businesses we build â€” are wired to fear change. Growth feels safe. Transformation feels dangerous.

But hereâ€™s the truth:

The real danger isnâ€™t transformation.The real danger is growing in the wrong direction.

Now, compare Kodak to Leica.

When digital photography disrupted the industry, most camera companies went the same route: faster production cycles, lower prices, mass-market appeal.

Leica did something radical.

They refused to chase growth.

Instead of expanding, they contracted. They leaned into their craftsmanship. They made fewer cameras, not more. They transformed from just another camera brand into an artifact of photographic mastery â€” a brand so deeply tied to identity and culture that it became irreplaceable.

Leica is not in the camera business.They are in the business of photographic storytelling.

And this is why they are more valuable than ever.

We assume that businesses need to keep growing to survive. But thatâ€™s not true. Some of the most successful brands today donâ€™t grow â€” they deepen.

Consider Bang & Olufsen. In the crowded world of consumer electronics, most brands chase bigger markets. Bang & Olufsen refused.

They focused on experience, aesthetics, and emotional connection. They transformed sound into a lifestyle.

ðŸ”¥ The Real Lesson? Transformation isnâ€™t about what you make.Itâ€™s about how you make people feel.

Hereâ€™s the real shift that companies need to understand:

A brand that chases growth is like a hero stuck in Act One of their own story.

The strongest brands donâ€™t just sell products; they help customers become something more.

This is the shift â€” from seeing the brand as the hero to seeing it as the mentor â€” that allows true transformation to take place.

Nike doesnâ€™t just sell shoes. They mentor you into seeing yourself as an athlete.Patagonia doesnâ€™t just sell jackets. They challenge you to think about your impact on the planet.

The brands that truly transform are the ones that evolve their own narratives to stay aligned with the aspirations of their audience.

The candle makers thought they were in the candle business. They werenâ€™t.

Kodak thought they were in the film business. They werenâ€™t.

Leica knew they werenâ€™t in the camera business. They were in the visual storytelling business.

So the question for every brand isnâ€™t how do we grow?

Itâ€™s how do we mentor and evolve?

Because growth is just a number. Transformation is how brands shape the future.
