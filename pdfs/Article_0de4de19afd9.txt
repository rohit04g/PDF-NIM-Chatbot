At the Rokid Ecosystem Conference: Spatial Joy 2024, held in Hefei, China, Pentagon Games proudly took the stage as an international developer, showcasing our latest innovation in immersive gaming technology. Competing in the Global AR App Development Competition Finals, we presented our first VR game, Fruit Slicer, designed exclusively for Rokid Glasses.

The event brought together top developers from around the world, each pushing the boundaries of what AR and VR technology can achieve. We were honored to stand alongside such talented innovators and contribute to this evolving space.

Our efforts culminated in receiving the prestigious CEO Award, with the Rokid CEO personally selecting Pentagon Games as one of the best international developers for our innovative work on Fruit Slicer. This recognition underscores our commitment to deliver high-quality, immersive gaming experiences and serves as a strong endorsement of our potential in the AR/VR space.

Behind Fruit Slicer and all our games lies Hexagon City, our Digital Cinematic and Interactive Experiences Platform. A robust digital platform that hosts our IPs and seamlessly integrates them with immersive technologies like Rokid Glasses. This platform serves as the backbone of our ability to deliver high-quality, dynamic content across various devices, creating cohesive and engaging experiences for players.

We are excited about the potential to further leverage Hexagon City to bring new content to Rokid Glasses, expanding the boundaries of what’s possible in AR and VR.

This milestone is just the beginning for Pentagon Games. Rokid has encouraged us to take on a new challenge and we’re answering that call.

Pentagon Games is exploring new ways to bring our immersive gaming ecosystem directly to players through a custom, portable, and lightweight AR device. This device will allow users to experience our ecosystem apps and games anytime, anywhere in a more immersive way. As part of this, we’ll also be integrating unique Web3 integrations that will enhance engagement, including earning opportunities, to empower players from day one.

We’re excited to explore new possibilities for the Rokid Glasses platform and beyond. We are also grateful to Rokid for this incredible opportunity and to our community for your continued support. Stay tuned for what’s next as we expand our vision for the future of gaming.
