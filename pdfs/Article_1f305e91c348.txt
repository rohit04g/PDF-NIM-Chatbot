I’ve found it increasingly hard to focus on one particular thing.

It’s not just about getting distracted when I’m working. It’s much more than that.

Sometimes, I catch myself chasing shiny things. New ideas to try, unrelated tasks to finish, or random thoughts to think about. I don’t even realize I’m distracted until I'm aware of it.

Distractions are everywhere.

But the scariest part is that distractions don’t feel like distractions. They often disguise themselves as the “right” thing to do.

For instance, when I’m supposed to finish writing, I suddenly think about doing chores like washing clothes or tidying up. These tasks are important, but they’re distractions in that moment. They pull me away from my primary goal.

Which is writing.

Social media, ads, and even content we enjoy are expertly designed to grab our attention.

They’re marketed as “entertainment,” but their real effect is to train us to crave constant stimulation.

“A 2018 Pew Research Center survey found that 31 per cent of teenagers in the US lost focus in class due to cell phone use. Additionally, while doing homework, 51 per cent of teenagers watch TV, 50 per cent use social media, 76 per cent listen to music, and 60 per cent send text messages.” → (Asmi Khanna)

So, when you doom-scroll through endless short videos, your ability to focus shrinks. This cycle conditions us to expect rapid gratification, leaving little room for the patience and persistence focus requires.

This isn’t what I want for myself and for you too.

Even though reclaiming focus isn’t an overnight success, it only takes a couple of days to feel it’s working.

Here’s what I’ve found effective:

I spend 20 minutes meditating every morning.

Meditation is a powerful exercise for focus. While meditating, my mind often wanders—to random thoughts, to-do lists, or worries. But instead of getting frustrated, I bring my attention back to my breath.

If I get distracted 30 times, that’s 30 opportunities to practice refocusing.

Each time I return to my breath, I’m training my mind to focus better, even in the chaos of daily life.

Short-form content can destroy your attention span.

Instead of mindlessly scrolling, I’ve replaced it with consuming content that adds value.

For example:

The key is to focus for a longer period of time.

Not for a minute or 15 seconds.

Practicing focus doesn’t mean distractions disappear overnight.

But over time, the effort compounds.

The more you practice, the better you’ll get at filtering out distractions and directing your attention where it truly matters.

You only need to be aware of it and go back to focus.

Focus is hard, but it’s not impossible to improve.

Start small. You don’t have to meditate for 20 minutes. You can meditate for a few minutes a day or commit to watching one video without distractions.

Build your ability to concentrate slowly, just as you build your muscle through working out.

It’s not about being perfect. It’s about showing up and practicing daily.

So, take the leap.

Rebuild your focus, one mindful moment at a time.
