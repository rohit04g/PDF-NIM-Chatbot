Some time series data follows clear trends or patterns, making it hard to model accurately. Most statistical methods assume stationarity — meaning the average level and variability of the series stay the same over time. But real-world data rarely cooperates. Temperatures rise, economies grow, and demand cycles up and down. If you don’t adjust for these trends, your models will misfire.

One of the simplest ways to fix this is differencing. Instead of working with the raw values, you subtract each observation from the one before it. This removes trends and makes the data more stable.

To illustrate, consider a time series with a clear upward trend. It keeps climbing, making it obvious that some kind of transformation is needed. The first step is first-order differencing, which subtracts each value from the one before it. This flattens a linear trend into a more stable series. If the trend is more complex — curved instead of straight — a single difference isn’t enough. A second difference, which applies the same operation again to the first differenced series, may be needed.

Keep going, and eventually, the data stops trending and hovers around a constant level. That’s when you know you’ve reached a stationary series.

The number of differencing steps depends on the shape of the original trend.

Once a series is stationary, you can apply statistical models like ARIMA. These models don’t work well on trending data, but they handle stationary series just fine.

Let’s apply differencing to something real — global surface temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020. This dataset, collected by NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, measures how much the Earth’s temperature deviates from a historical baseline.

Differencing is one of the easiest ways to make a time series stationary. It removes trends, stabilizes the mean, and lets statistical models do their job. After differencing, always check the data to make sure you haven’t gone too far — if the series looks like random noise, you may have overdone it. In the next chapter, we’ll look at how to determine the right number of differences using statistical tests and visual inspection.
