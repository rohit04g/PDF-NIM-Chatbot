As a UI/UX designer, I always aim to explore creative ways to push my design boundaries and improve my skills. A few weeks ago, a well-known company assigned me a task during an interview to redesign the landing page of their platform, “VisualizePro,” a data visualization service tailored to startups and small businesses. This experience pushed me to experiment with AI tools and integrate them into my design process, and I want to share this journey with you.

The company’s brief was straightforward: they needed a redesign that would showcase the value of their data visualization tools while emphasizing their services for small businesses and startups. My challenge was to communicate this clearly, and with impact, using Figma — my go-to design tool.

Initially, I began by conducting thorough research. I explored competitor websites, paying attention to how they presented their services and catered to the needs of small businesses. This research helped me understand the user personas and identify key elements that would appeal to this target audience, such as simplicity, visual clarity, and user-friendly navigation.

Despite my research, I found it challenging to break through the design block and define the exact approach. That’s when I decided to leverage AI for assistance.

Instead of spending more time getting stuck in the design dilemma, I turned to ChatGPT. I input specific queries about designing a landing page for a SaaS company like VisualizePro. ChatGPT generated ideas, structure suggestions, and even provided insights on how to organize the homepage and emphasize features effectively.

For instance, I asked ChatGPT how to best highlight a call-to-action (CTA) button or how to convey the concept of data visualization in a visually compelling way. These insights gave me a solid foundation to proceed with, allowing me to design more confidently and quickly.

Once I had the structure and ideas from ChatGPT, I set up the layout in Figma. I created two versions of the landing page design: one for desktop and one for mobile. Here’s how I broke down the layout:

Hero Section: The hero section needed to capture attention immediately. I added a bold heading — “Transform Your Data into Insight in Seconds” — with a bright CTA button saying “Start Visualizing.” The background featured a clean, illustrative representation of data analytics in action, reinforcing the product’s value.

Service/Product Section: I used a card-based design for the services section, with clear headings for each product offering (e.g., Real-Time Data Tracking, Custom Dashboards). Each card contained an icon and a brief description of the feature, designed for quick scanning.

About/Testimonials Section: In this section, I highlighted VisualizePro’s impact on startups. I used success metrics like “99% Client Satisfaction” alongside real user testimonials, visually supported by icons and illustrations to create a friendly and trust-building atmosphere.

CTA and Contact Section: The page ends with a strong, clear CTA button: “Get a Free Demo.” Additionally, I ensured that the contact information and inquiry form were easy to locate, ensuring users could easily reach out for further engagement.

Since the task required a responsive design, I made sure that both the desktop and mobile versions of the landing page were fully optimized for different screen sizes. In Figma, I created constraints and used auto-layout to ensure that the elements would adapt smoothly to varying screen sizes.

To ensure consistency across the entire redesign, I also created a design system for the VisualizePro website. The system included the following elements:

In addition to the landing page redesign, I was also tasked with creating two visuals using basic shapes to convey abstract concepts. The challenge was to depict conflict and balance using only a rectangle, triangle, and circle. Here’s how I approached the design:

Frame 1 — Conflict (Shapes Fighting): For the first visual, I designed a dynamic “battle” between the triangle and rectangle. The triangle and rectangle appear to be clashing, with sharp edges colliding to create a sense of tension. The circle is passive, caught in the middle of the conflict. I tilted the rectangle to give the impression that it was overpowering the triangle. To emphasize the struggle, I added dynamic lines and motion blur. A small explosion or crack between the shapes amplifies the conflict, reinforcing the energy and force of their interaction.

Frame 2 — Balance: In the second visual, I reoriented the shapes to create a sense of harmony. The triangle, rectangle, and circle are positioned in a balanced, symmetrical layout, representing equilibrium and peace. The shapes are aligned in a way that visually conveys the idea of unity, with soft shadows and subtle gradients to suggest a calm, balanced atmosphere.

To ensure the project’s clarity and structure, I documented the entire design process. This included the rationale behind design decisions, such as the choice of colors, typography, and layout. I also provided context on how each section would appeal to the target audience — startups and small businesses. This documentation allowed the client to better understand the reasoning behind each design choice.

This redesign task was an exciting challenge that pushed me to blend AI-powered tools with my design knowledge to achieve a functional and visually appealing solution. By leveraging ChatGPT for research, ideation, and refinement, I was able to expedite the process and focus on delivering a well-rounded design. The process wasn’t just about designing a landing page, but about creating an experience that would resonate with startups and small businesses.

The project also reinforced my belief in continuously experimenting with new tools and techniques to enhance my design workflow. I’m looking forward to implementing more AI-assisted processes in my future design projects.
