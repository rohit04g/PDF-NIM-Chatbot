I grew up in the cold, but over the past 15–20 years, I’ve lived in warmer and milder climates until about a week ago. It’s an adjustment — the snappy cold fronts require a little moxy in the mornings, and more layers of clothing are needed when venturing outside. It’s not for the wimpish.

But winter brings a layer of softness with all its harshness. We slow down. Driveways require shoveling before departing, plants become dormant, and the daylight hours are shorter, often limiting our activity. We may even need more sleep. I crave different foods that are heartier in substance. It’s all perfectly normal.

The key for me is to venture outside. Even when I don’t feel like it. Winter requires a little more effort, that’s all.

In the depth of winter, I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer. — Albert Camus

A bit of discomfort builds character.

Make an effort and embrace the discomfort. Happy Saturday!
