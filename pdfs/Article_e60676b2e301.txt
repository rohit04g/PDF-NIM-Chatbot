A chilling trend has gripped the consciousness of many in Western Nigeria, particularly amplified across the bustling digital squares of Facebook. It’s a trend that not only stains our humanity, it also taints our culture, value system and challenges whatever is left of our conscience: the horrifying resurgence of using human beings for money rituals. For many of us, it deeply wounds our faith. This isn’t a shadowy whisper in hushed tones; it’s a scream amplified by social media, laid bare in gruesome detail, and tragically embodied by cases like the recent arrest of a supposed young Muslim cleric in Ilorin caught with human parts, alleged to have murdered his own fiancé.

This isn’t just a societal problem; it’s a crisis of identity, especially for Muslims in Nigeria. When headlines scream about a “Muslim cleric” involved in such barbaric acts, the name of Islam itself is dragged through the mud. The faith, meant to be a beacon of peace, justice, and the sanctity of life, is horrifyingly misrepresented. As a young striving Muslim myself who deeply cares about the integrity of our faith, I feel compelled to address this head-on. This isn’t just about condemning individuals; it’s about confronting a scourge that is eating away at the very fabric of our Muslim community and demanding immediate, impactful solutions.

Let’s be unequivocally clear: Islam utterly condemns the act of taking an innocent human life. The Qur’an, our sacred guide book, is resoundingly clear on this matter. Suratul-Ma’idah (5:32) states with absolute clarity:

“…whoever kills a soul (unless for a soul or for corruption done in the land) — it is as if he had slain the entire mankind. And whoever saves one — it is as if he had saved mankind in entirety.”

This verse isn’t open to any misguided/misconstrued interpretation whatsoever, it was stated in unambiguous terms. It establishes the profound sanctity of human life. To take a life unjustly is likened to destroying all of humanity, while saving a life is equivalent to saving all of humanity. Where then, is the Islamic justification for ritual killings? There is none.

Furthermore, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) emphasized the gravity of murder in numerous Ahaadith. He said, “The greatest of sins are to associate partners in worship with Allah, to be undutiful to one’s parents, to kill a soul Allah has forbidden, except in due cause, and to lie.” (Bukhari). To shed innocent blood is not just a sin; it is amongst the gravest of sins in Islam. It is a direct violation of the core tenets of our faith, which preach compassion, mercy, and the preservation of life.

When individuals, especially those who wear the garb of Islamic scholars- the Islamic pseudo scholars are implicated in such heinous crimes, it sends shockwaves through the Muslim community and beyond. It provides ammunition to those who seek to malign Islam, the Isese mongers among other non-believers; reinforcing harmful stereotypes and fueling Islamophobia. The image of Islamic scholars, who are supposed to be custodians of knowledge and moral guidance, is tarnished. The trust that the community places in religious leaders is eroded. This is a deep wound that requires urgent and sincere healing.

We must ask ourselves: how did we get here? How did a practice so fundamentally opposed to Islamic teachings take root within communities that identify as Muslim? The answer is complex, interwoven with factors like societal pressures, economic desperation, and perhaps, a dangerous misinterpretation or manipulation of religious beliefs by unscrupulous individuals. However, acknowledging the complexities does not excuse the crime, nor does it diminish our responsibility to act decisively.

So, what must be done? Here are some crucial steps we need to take, not as mere suggestions, but as imperatives:

1. Unequivocal Condemnation from Islamic Leaders and Institutions: Today we see some our so-called scholars flaunting wealth and promoting illegitimate means of seeking wealth in the open in an unprecedented manner. This is insane! Our Imams, scholars, and Islamic organizations must be at the forefront of unequivocally condemning these acts. This condemnation must be loud, consistent, and unambiguous. Sermons, lectures, online platforms, and every available avenue must be utilized to reiterate Islam’s absolute prohibition of ritual killings and the sanctity of human life. We need to see prominent scholars actively engaging on platforms like Facebook, X, TikTok, and Instagram where this trend is sadly visible, to counter the narrative and educate the masses.

2. Collaboration with Law Enforcement and implementation of shariah Justice System: While addressing the spiritual and educational aspects is crucial, we must also advocate for robust law enforcement and a just legal system that effectively investigates, prosecutes, and punishes those involved in ritual killings. There should be no tolerance for such crimes, and perpetrators must face the full force of the law. Unfortunately, every enemy of Islam are seriously sponsoring campaign of calumny against introducing shariah court in the west. do you think with shariah court that’s rightly empowered to try such criminal case in place, there will be a murder in the first place? In the shariah justice system, it’s an eye for an eye; a soul for a soul. and Allah rightly said in Suratul Baqorah (2:178),

“Oh believers! ˹The law of˺ retaliation is set for you in cases of murder — a free man for a free man, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female. But if the offender is pardoned by the victim’s guardian, then blood-money should be decided fairly and payment should be made courteously. This is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. But whoever transgresses after that will suffer a painful punishment.”

and in the next verse what did He say? “There is ˹security of˺ life for you in ˹the law of˺ retaliation, Oh people of reason/understanding, so that you may become mindful ˹of Allah˺.”

Please find a cool place to take chilled sobo or kunnu aayah or ice-cream with popcorn, and ponder on these verses.

3. Community Engagement and Dialogue: Mosques and Islamic centers should become hubs for community engagement, fostering dialogue on pressing social issues like ritual killings. We need to create safe spaces for people to voice their concerns, ask questions, and seek guidance. We need to work with community leaders, social workers, and law enforcement agencies to address the root causes of such crimes and offer support to vulnerable individuals and communities.

4. Counter-Narratives on Social Media and Media Platforms: We must actively combat the spread of misinformation and harmful narratives surrounding ritual killings, especially on social media platforms like Facebook. We need to create and disseminate compelling counter-narratives that highlight Islam’s true teachings and expose the falsehood and barbarity of these acts. Muslim content creators, influencers, and media outlets have a crucial role to play in this.

5. Robust Islamic Education and Awareness Campaigns: We need to invest in comprehensive Islamic education that emphasizes the core values of Islam, particularly the sanctity of life and the prohibition of violence against innocent beings. This education must start from childhood and continue throughout life, reaching every corner of our communities. We need to equip our youth with the knowledge to discern true Islamic teachings from harmful deviations and manipulations. Special attention should be paid to combating superstitious beliefs that might be exploited to justify such heinous acts.

6. Addressing Socio-economic Factors: While poverty and economic hardship can never justify such horrific crimes, it is important to acknowledge that desperation can drive individuals to extreme measures. As a community, we need to work towards alleviating poverty, promoting economic empowerment, and creating opportunities for our youth. A just and equitable society reduces the likelihood of individuals resorting to desperate and criminal acts.

This is not just about cleaning up the image of Islam; it’s about protecting innocent lives, upholding the moral fabric of our society, and staying true to the core values of our faith. The blood of innocent victims cries out for justice, and the tarnished image of Islam demands urgent repair. We, as Muslims, as Nigerians, as human beings, must rise to this challenge with unwavering resolve and determined action. The time to act is now, before more lives are tragically lost, and before the stain on our collective conscience deepens further. Let us reclaim the narrative and demonstrate, through our actions, that Islam stands firmly and unequivocally against such barbaric acts, and for the sanctity of human life, justice, and peace.
