Taylor Swift is a talented singer, an outstanding artist whose brand is so strong that it has an impact on the economies of entire countries.

But Taylor Swift is also a very exciting business case. She is one of the smartest businesswomen of her generation and is unique in how deftly she has used the Internet since the beginning of her career.

How is it that one person can have such an impact? There are several lessons from branding and doing business in general (especially for startups starting their own business) that Taylor Swift teaches us.

The mechanics of the music industry are similar to those of the venture capital industry. Music labels have A&R representatives, whose job is to find talent. They look for the next big thing. As soon as a label signs an artist, it offers advance financing for the production of an album and then contracts ownership of the rights to the album and any profits made from it. The industry is complicated, but the point is that like an enterprise, most artists fail, while those who succeed, like Taylor Swift, make up for the losses.

So, in Nashville, RCA Records paid attention to a young Taylor Swift. However, there was one problem: they didn’t want her to be a country singer or songwriter. RCA looked at the data and realized that country music was losing popularity with young listeners. They saw Taylor as a teenager who could be used in a different segment of the market, one that they thought would be more profitable.

They were wrong, of course.

Taylor Swift turned down an offer from RCA, unheard of for a promising artist.

“I didn’t just want to be another singer. I wanted there to be something that would set me apart from others, and I knew it had to be my text. There are two types of people. The first people saw me as an artist and judged me by my music. Others judge me by a number, by my age, which means nothing. It’s not customary in Nashville to turn down a major record deal, but that’s exactly what I did.”

— Taylor Swift.

Why does this story have some instructive subtext?

The key conclusion here is that RCA underestimated the market. Yes, country music among young people’s audience was falling. However, great products can revitalize stagnant markets and even expand them. Taylor Swift did both: first, proving that there were opportunities in country music and then going beyond it to become a true pop star.

Her story is similar to the fatal mistake startups often make when entering new markets: underestimating their size.

Excellent products can significantly expand markets, as Airbnb has done with cohabitation, Tesla with electric cars, and Red Bull with energy drinks, which currently stands at $53 billion globally and is expected to grow at a rate of 7.2% annually through 2027. Taylor Swift is a classic tale of a great product that has expanded the market. This story has been told over and over in the world of technology. From a business perspective, not investing in a company based solely on its market size can be a grave mistake.

One of the consequences of the digital age is that the world has become able to create global, dynamic online communities. This manifests itself for businesses in communicating with customers and users and for artists in communicating with their fans.

Taylor Swift’s apparent closeness to her fans is an integral part of her personal brand and is much more significant than that of other popular singers like Rihanna, Adele, or Lady Gaga. Don’t think about the super-rich singer’s private jets, but rather look at her cats, be touched by her Christmas video from childhood, read some of the books she reads, and here are some old diary entries and a photo from her family holiday. Taylor talks about each song from her new album, Midnights, with a glass of wine in her hand.

Swift and her team zealously guard the intimate aspects of an artist’s personal life while strategically opening a window or two into their world, allowing fans to view Taylor as their girlfriend (she even talks to them about this).

Better than any other artist, Taylor meets fans where they live: on the Internet. From the very beginning, she realized the power of nurturing and growing a loyal online community.

“Community” has become a buzzword in the startup world. Successful businesses know how to grow their communities, making them a powerful tool.

While more and more companies are “formalizing” community management, Taylor Swift is doing the diametrically opposite thing — becoming a friend to them. She supports them (the subscriber wrote asking for help in the comments under the singer’s post, and Taylor personally wrote her a note of support, sending her a check for $ 15,000), cheers, rejoices with them, and shares her worries.

This creates a strong community of like-minded people, thereby reinforcing the brand.

The manner of hiding “Easter eggs” in album covers and song lyrics is certainly not new. Still, Taylor Swift is so fond of leaving secret messages to fans always and everywhere that she even ironically played it in a comedic interlude inside the Anti-hero clip.

These messages can be as obvious as possible (to guess that the song Dear John sings about John Meyer, you need minimal detective work) or such that years later cause heated debate within the fan community. So, the word KARMA, written on the wall in The Man’s video, along with other evidence allegedly points to the album of the same name, recorded but not released due to the scandal with Taylor’s not fully agreed mention in Kanye West’s Famous song.

The artist’s interaction with fans results in a kind of parasocial game, where every Swift action does not exist by itself, but requires interpretation and cataloging. This only contributes to the Swifties’ self-organization and engagement, making them a force to be reckoned with.

What conclusion can we draw from this? It is important not only to communicate with your audience but also to hook them, especially in the beginning. Create a deep, penetrating storytelling that will make the consumer want to buy more, and make them think. Emotionally engage by creating a certain complementary image around the product.

The artist’s fans are people who buy every album, pack the halls, and purchase the most expensive tickets on tour.

Customers loyal to the brand, like fans of an artist, are the source of the company’s “vitality.” People who have the highest spending, most active use, and best retention are important to reward.

Taylor Swift rewards her most loyal followers. She has always rewarded her superfans. Regular fans may receive a Tumblr reblog, Instagram comment, or TikTok. The most enthusiastic fans get something better — an invitation to a secret session. Secret sessions are private meetings at Taylor’s home where she unveils her new album to a select group of fans who have signed strict NDAs.Such strong loyalty also affects related industries. For example, vinyl records are currently booming, fueled by the desire of young people to own a physical symbol of their fandom (a symbol of community and belonging). In 2021, vinyl records surpassed CD sales for the first time in 35 years. Half of the people who bought vinyl don’t even have a record player!

An important lesson to learn from this is to be closer to the audience, and to thank them for their loyalty — this gives an even greater response to the brand, increasing trust in it (because this is how we make the consumer and the brand closer to each other).

One simple truth plays a role here. Taylor Swift, through her image and strategy of interacting with the audience, conveys timeless values that are appreciated by the audience. And the most important thing is that this is done with a sincere message.

Moreover, philanthropy and speaking out on social, political, and other public topics is a key part of Taylor Swift’s brand. So, her video “You Need To Calm Down” was a direct response to anti-LGBT laws in the United States. She is also known for donating to various charities and has also supported singer Kesha by paying her legal fees against Dr. Luke.

This strategy is also applicable in business marketing. The brand needs to convey values that are close to its audience, and at the same time not only talk about them but actively reinforce them with actions and activities.

Taylor Swift has proven time and time again that she is an innovator in her industry. From re-recording old albums and adding songs from the repository to Taylor’s Versions compilation to creating extended versions of his hit songs, Taylor knows how to recycle his old material and make it sound completely new.

Moreover, in her work, she successfully applies the technique of the concept of “eras”. Each of her albums or creative periods has its on style, message, and image, it’s all backed up by visual and verbal attributes, broadcast in the media and at Taylor’s concerts. Thus, by creating peculiar “worlds” of his work, Taylor introduces innovation in the music industry, thereby gaining sympathy.

All this is a well-designed strategy that encourages the user to fully immerse himself in her “product”. Fans of the artist catalog the references and can recognize in any new Taylor media narrative the layering of certain “eras”, which opens up completely new opportunities for the production of merch: imagine that now you are not collecting artists’ T-shirts, but “er T-shirts”, the collection of which is regularly updated. And we haven’t started talking about hyperlinks inside song lyrics that send swifties to re-listen to old tracks.

Any brand or startup needs to retain the user and get away from the primitive “just using” the product. Be innovators in your industry, come up with new ways to personify your products following values, involving the target audience in the process — and you will get a competitive advantage that will be difficult for your competitors to adopt.

Today, we see an incredible number of brands in the world. They are of different colors, and types, and offer their consumers a full range of services and products. Therefore, in such an abundance of information and supply, the consumer is increasingly scrupulous and careful in his choice. It is important to offer him not just a product, but a full-fledged experience that responds to his values and attracts him, turning him from an average user into a loyal “fan”.

That’s what Taylor Swift did. So what can you do in your startup?
