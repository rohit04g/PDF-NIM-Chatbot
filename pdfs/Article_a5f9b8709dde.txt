We’re often eager to dive straight into coding when starting a new project. However, rushing into implementation without proper validation can lead to significant challenges down the road.

There’s a Japanese idiom “急がば回れ” (isogaba-maware) meaning “more haste, less speed.” This perfectly illustrates why rushing into development can be problematic:

Unforeseen issues slows you(and your team) down

If you don’t understand the nitty-gritty parts of what you are building, you(or your poor teammate) might have to spend a load of time figuring out what’s not working.

If you are a tech lead or any other role that leads a project, I strongly recommend dedicating significant time to thoroughly testing new frameworks and tools before implementation. This hands-on exploration allows you to identify and solve potential roadblocks early, when solutions are less costly and disruptive to the team.

Last-minute deal breaking Issues

Let me share my story on this. I once had a situation where I had to reimplement the entire authentication system just before the production launch because the authentication tool we were using did not support using the same domain for multiple applications.

This was extremely frustrating, but I could have avoided it if I had spent a little more time checking the setup as a part of PoC.

Unpredictable requirements and risks

Without a PoC, accurately estimating the project’s time, workload, and risk becomes nearly impossible. This uncertainty can lead to missed deadlines and exceeded budgets.

Now that you understand the importance of a PoC, let’s explore how to create one. Here are my practices to make my Proof of Concept truly valuable:

Set Clear, Focused Goals

Define specific objectives for your PoC. What exactly are you trying to validate? For instance: “Verify that the chosen API can handle 1000 concurrent requests” or “Confirm that the authentication flow works across all target platforms.”

Keep it Simple, S

Don’t spend time on trivial things.

Maintain a Template Project Library

Create and maintain a collection of starter templates for different types of projects. This approach saves time and ensures consistency in your prototyping process. These are templates that I use for Node.js or CDK project.

github.com

github.com

Document Everything!!

This will really help you and your colleagues down the road

Set time limit

Keep in mind this is like an investment in your project… don’t spend too much time! It also helps you prevent scope creep.

Welcome Early Feedback

Share your PoC with colleagues and stakeholders as soon as possible. Fresh perspectives can reveal blind spots in your approach.

PoC is also incredibly effective for convincing your team. Nothing says “trust me” like showing something that actually works. Skip the endless debates; just flash the PoC :)
