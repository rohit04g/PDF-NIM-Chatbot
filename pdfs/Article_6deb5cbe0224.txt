Photography, at its best, is more than just capturing a scene — it’s about revealing connections, emotions, and deeper truths. The relationship between humanity and nature, how we inhabit and impact our surroundings, is something I think about constantly.

There’s always this tension between presence and preservation, between our need for space and the way we alter the landscapes around us. Through photography, I try to explore not just the external environment but the internal one — the way places shape us, the way we feel within them, and the way we sometimes take more than we give back.

The way we engage with the external world — the landscapes we walk through, the waters we dive into, the forests we lose ourselves in — often mirrors something deeper within us. Photography, especially when tied to conservation and the natural world, becomes a reflection not just of the land and sea but of our own internal landscapes.

The Internal Wilderness

We often think of nature as something separate from us — something we visit, photograph, or try to protect. But we are nature. The rhythms of the ocean, the patterns of the wind, the silence of the mountains — they all exist within us too. Yet, modern life has created a disconnect, a forgetting. Photography has the power to rekindle that connection, to serve as a mirror for what we’ve lost or are trying to reclaim.

When I photograph the vastness of the ocean or the weight of a dying tree in a burned-out forest, I’m not just documenting an external reality — I’m exploring an emotional truth. The ocean reflects the deep, untamed parts of the self, the places where memories and emotions shift like tides. A dying tree speaks to the things within us that have endured too many fires but still stand.

How We Take Up Space

Our relationship with the environment says a lot about how we relate to ourselves. Do we move through the world with care, leaving as little trace as possible? Or do we consume, extract, and dominate without considering the consequences?

The Camera as a Tool for Self-Reflection

For me, photography isn’t just about what’s in front of the lens. It’s about what happens behind it. The act of composing an image — slowing down, noticing light, framing a moment — requires a kind of stillness. It asks us to be fully present, to see with intention.

When we look at a photograph, we see more than just an image; we see an imprint of a moment in time, a fragment of awareness. And sometimes, in the right image, we see ourselves. Not just as the person who took the photo, but as the person who felt something in that moment.

A Question of Belonging

Ultimately, photography — especially conservation photography — isn’t just about protecting nature. It’s about remembering that we belong to it. That our inner and outer environments are deeply connected. That the way we care for one reflects how we care for the other.

Perhaps the real question is: When we look at the natural world, do we see ourselves as part of it? Or do we see ourselves as separate? The answer to that might shape everything.
