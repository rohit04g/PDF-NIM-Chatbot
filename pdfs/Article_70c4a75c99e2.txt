AbortController is a JavaScript interface that allows you to cancel one or more DOM requests (like Fetch API calls) as and when needed. It provides a way to abort fetch requests.

Imagine you‚Äôre building a search feature for an e-commerce app. Every time a user types a letter (like ‚Äúw‚Äù, then ‚Äúwi‚Äù, then ‚Äúwir‚Äù‚Ä¶), your app sends a new Fetch request. If the user types fast, older requests might resolve after newer ones, causing outdated results to flicker on the screen. Worse, if they leave the page mid-fetch, React might try to update a component that‚Äôs already gone, leading to errors.

By using AbortController, you can cancel pending Fetch requests, ensuring that your application remains efficient.

Now, let‚Äôs see how to use AbortController with React .

Step 1: Create an AbortController

The signal property is an AbortSignal object that can be passed to the Fetch API to associate it with the controller.

Step 2: Pass the Signal to Fetch

Next, you pass the signal to the fetch function as part of the options object.

Step 3: Abort the Fetch Request

To abort the fetch request, you call the abort method on the AbortController instance.

Let‚Äôs create a React component for searching products. We‚Äôll use AbortController to cancel outdated searches.

Breaking It Down üîç

Using AbortController with the Fetch API in ReactJS is a powerful way to manage and cancel fetch requests. It helps in making your application more efficient and responsive by avoiding unnecessary network requests and potential memory leaks.

Happy coding!
