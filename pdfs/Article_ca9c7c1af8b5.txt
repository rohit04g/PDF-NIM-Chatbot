If you’re diving into design patterns in JavaScript, you’ll need to understand how object-oriented programming works in our favorite language. Trust me, it’s quite different from what you might have seen in Java or C++, but that’s what makes it special!

Let’s break this down into digestible pieces and see how it all fits together with some real-world examples.

Think of classical inheritance (like in Java) as a blueprint system. When you create a class, it’s like creating a blueprint for a house. Every house you build from that blueprint is an exact copy of the specifications.

JavaScript, however, uses prototypal inheritance, which is more like learning by example. Instead of rigid blueprints, objects can inherit directly from other objects. It’s more flexible and dynamic.

Let’s see this in action:

Here’s what’s happening under the hood:

Real-world scenario: Think of building a game with different types of characters. Each character inherits basic properties and methods from a base character, but can override them as needed:

Even though JavaScript now has class syntax, it’s important to understand that these are just a nicer way to write the same prototypal inheritance under the hood. However, they make our code much cleaner and more intuitive.

Here’s how classes help us implement design patterns more elegantly:

Real-world scenario: Imagine you’re building a dashboard application that needs to maintain consistent configuration across different components:

Here’s what happens step by step:

First time (dashConfig = new DashboardConfig()):

Second time (sameConfig = new DashboardConfig()):

This pattern is called a Singleton, ensuring you always work with the same instance of the configuration across your entire application. Think of it like having only one remote control for your TV - no matter who picks it up, they’re all using the same one!

While inheritance is useful, composition often gives us more flexibility. Think of it as building with LEGO blocks instead of carving from a single piece of wood.

Here’s a practical example of composition vs inheritance:

Real-world scenario: Building a document editor with different capabilities:

Modern JavaScript modules help us organize our code better and implement design patterns more effectively. Here’s how:

Testing is crucial when implementing design patterns. Here’s how to test our previous examples using Vitest:

JavaScript’s prototypal inheritance is more flexible than classical inheritance

Remember, the goal of using these patterns isn’t to make your code more complex — it’s to make it more maintainable and easier to understand. Start simple, and add complexity only when it truly adds value to your codebase.

Now that you understand the fundamentals of OOP in JavaScript, you’re ready to dive into specific design patterns. In the next article, we’ll explore the Singleton pattern in depth and see how these concepts apply in real-world scenarios.

Happy coding!
