Let’s not look at the scoreboard.

We know it doesn’t tell the whole story.

It only captures a moment in time. It doesn’t show all the passion, focus, and resilience we brought to the game.

If you are like me, for every win we collect, we have plenty of “BUTs” attached to it. We feel good, but not great. We scored one goal but should have scored two. We see the standing ovation but fixate on that one person not clapping.

As perfectionists, we are masters at convincing ourselves we can never truly win. We brush off victories while we can spend days dwelling on defeats. Every misstep feels like a championship lost, every setback like a season-ending injury.

Yes, we likely messed up, missed out, misspoke, or misjudged this past year.

We probably did all of the above. I know, it wasn’t always fun.

We all had our moments — good, bad, and imperfect.

That’s part of the game.

That’s how we get better.

There is a lesson to learn in every defeat, an opportunity for growth, and a springboard for an epic comeback.

Mistakes and failures don’t define us unless we let them. They sting, hurt, and may even leave us feeling shame or regret in the moment, but they don’t define us. What truly matters is how we react to the challenges along the way, and step back into the game.

We weren’t built for the sidelines.

Welcome to our boldest play yet: taking a moment to slow down and reflect.

I have created 12 Sports-inspired prompts to help us rewrite our relationship with perfectionism and finally notice, appreciate, and celebrate our progress.

You can use this guide however (and whenever) you like. Whether you answer all the questions or just one, there’s no perfect way to do this — just an honest one.

Write your responses in a journal. It helps track patterns and insights over time. But if you prefer to reflect out loud or just think through your answers — that works, too. Choose what feels right for you.

Finally, a friendly piece of advice before you start:

✋ Check your perfectionism at the door (focus on progress)🥰 Embrace self-compassion (be your own team mate)🥳 Have fun! (nobody is keeping score!)

What big victory did you almost brush off? Just listen to your heart, not your brain. Take a moment to celebrate something magical you did — even if in the moment it didn’t feel quite perfect enough.

Those moments when you showed up for others — offering candid feedback when it was easier to stay quiet, sharing credit for a win that could have been yours alone, or simply being there when a teammate doubted themselves.

Sometimes, our most valuable plays aren’t the obvious saves, but the ones that help others level up.

Kindness is a badass act, too.

You know, the kind of compliment that made you stop and think ‘Wait, people appreciate that about me?’

Consider the praises you received that highlight strengths you might take for granted, or talents you didn’t even realize were making an impact.

Are you sure you always need a medal to call it a victory? Consider the small wins that didn’t make headlines but showed your growth.

The habits you built, the fears you faced, the boundaries you set — these are victories too, even if no one else saw them.

Look back at those situations when you preferred the safe play instead of the bold one. Where did your fear of imperfection keep you sitting on the sidelines?

This isn’t about beating yourself up — it’s about recognizing those subtle moments when the pursuit of flawless might have held you back from something meaningful.

Was it truly a miss, or were you up against factors beyond your control? Or maybe did someone else just play a better game?

Sometimes the outcome is beyond our control. Sometimes, another player simply outplayed us that day. Learning to tell the difference — that’s part of getting better.

What if you looked at this moment through the eyes of a friend? Would they see the same story you’ve been telling yourself?

What felt like your toughest loss — and what surprising lessons did it teach you? How did that challenge reshape your approach?

What wisdom would you share with someone facing the same moment now?

Our inner saboteurs — those voices of self-doubt and criticism — can be our toughest opponents.

Maybe it’s the restless achiever always pushing for more, the people pleaser afraid to disappoint, or the controller needing everything to be just right. When did your saboteur show up, and what triggered it?

Click here to learn more about the type of saboteurs you may encounter.

Did you take it? How did that feel?

And if you didn’t, what got in the way of your self-care?

What would you do more or differently next time you’ll feel exhausted?

Who made your highlight reel this year — not just the obvious champions in your corner, but the unexpected allies?

The ones who challenged you to grow, caught you when you stumbled, or simply shared an act of kindness after a tough game?

Some support changes everything. Let’s celebrate those who made the difference for us.

Who inspired you this year — what qualities or approaches did you admire in others that you’d like to make your own?

Don’t aim for perfection, focus on the learnings. What would you keep, and what would you change? Remember, even champions adjust their game plan.

Congratulations on taking the time to reflect on your journey. Acknowledging our strengths & vulnerabilities and being honest with ourselves takes courage and self-compassion. It’s a victory worth celebrating.

Don’t wait until you’ve reached your goal to be proud of yourself. Be proud of every step you take toward reaching that goal — Simone Biles

As you look ahead, here are three final prompts to help you continue choosing progress over perfection:

It feels good to let go of perfectionism, not to lower our standards or compromise on our dreams but, as Simone Biles said, to appreciate every step we take toward reaching our goals.

Thank you for playing along. Keep having fun in 2025!
