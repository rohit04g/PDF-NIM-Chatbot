Why do we delay ourselves from ourselves? Why do we postpone our dreams and ambitions?

I haven’t written a Her Money Mondays blog post in over a year. When I first started, I set a high bar for myself — committing to posting every Monday. But as a high-achieving eldest daughter, setting high bars is my default programming.

For a long time, I felt ashamed for letting myself down on a project that meant so much to me. But today, I’m choosing to release that shame and recommit. I may only have one life to live, but I deserve to give myself multiple chances.

What sparked this return? Attending and speaking at Villanova’s Let’s Talk Money: Taking the Lead on Your Financial Wellness event. The keynote speaker, Mical Y. Jeanlys-White — Founder and CEO of WealthMore — shared powerful insights on financial wellness. She spoke about how building wealth is a lifestyle, much like being a foodie or a travel enthusiast. That perspective resonated deeply with me, and I may dedicate a future blog post to unpacking all the gems from her talk.

I also had the privilege of speaking on a panel with two phenomenal women, Emily and Marissa. Together, we embodied the event’s theme by doing exactly what we encourage others to do — talk about money. It was difficult to step out of my comfort zone, but I am glad I did it. That conversation, too, deserves its own blog post.

But today, this post is about something bigger. It’s about celebrating my return and recommitting to this blog. Consider it a vow renewal — to honor and cherish the gifts, passions, and desires that God has placed within me.

For anyone struggling with an unfinished project or a dream they’ve set aside, I highly recommend listening to the podcast episode The Power of Recommitment & Return by Soul Salon with Ayandastood. In it, she beautifully articulates how leaving and returning are part of nature. We are a part of nature. Maybe you’ve been in a winter season — give yourself permission to step into spring and begin again.

Here’s to new beginnings. Here’s to showing up again.
